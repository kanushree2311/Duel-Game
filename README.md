# FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT WITH PYTHON- TECHWAVE 
Hi I made this project during Full Stack development with Python Training program, conducted by <b>TechWave</b>.

## About the project:
The project is about a duel game with 4 different players- King, Queen, Knight, Joker. Each player have health, attack, defence points stored in the form of a 
dictionary individually. Using the concept of Object Oriented Programming in python, a duel battle is performed between the players. In the end, the winner is announced.

## Tech Stack used: 
Object Oriented Programming with Python

## How the game goes on:
Any 2 players can be chosen- King, Queen, Knight, Joker. 
When player-1 attacks on player-2, player-1 uses it's attack points and player-2 uses it's defence points. Each player has fair and random chances to dodge 
the attack and maintain their health points. When player-1 is successful in it's attack and player-2 fails to defend then, the damage caused to player-2 is 
the attack done by player-1 and hence attack points of player-1 gets reduced from player-2 health points. Each player has fair additional +5 health points which 
is given only when their health is marginally low. In the end which ever player is left with health equal to zero or smaller than zero is the final loser and 
the other one is the final winner.
